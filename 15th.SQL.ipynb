    "Database:\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, management,\n",
    "and updating of that data. Databases are widely used in various applications and play a crucial role in storing and managing information \n",
    "for software systems. They can be classified into different types based on their structure and the way they organize data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) Database:\n",
    "SQL databases are relational databases that use Structured Query Language (SQL) for defining and manipulating the data.\n",
    "They are also known as Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). Key characteristics of SQL databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Structured Data:\n",
    "   - SQL databases organize data into tables with predefined schemas. Each table has rows and columns, and relationships \n",
    "   between tables are established through keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ACID Properties:\n",
    "   - SQL databases adhere to ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), ensuring transactions are processed \n",
    "   reliably and consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Schema:\n",
    "   - The structure of the data (schema) is defined in advance, and any changes to the schema require careful planning and often result in downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scalability:\n",
    "   - SQL databases are typically vertically scalable, meaning you can increase the capacity of a single server by increasing\n",
    "   things like CPU, RAM, or SSD.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Examples:\n",
    "   - MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    " NoSQL Database:\n",
    "NoSQL databases are non-relational databases designed to handle various types of unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data. \n",
    "They are more flexible and can handle large volumes of data with diverse structures. Key characteristics of NoSQL databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flexible Schema:\n",
    "   - NoSQL databases allow for dynamic schema, meaning you can insert data without first defining its structure. \n",
    "   This flexibility is particularly useful for handling diverse and evolving data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. BASE Properties:\n",
    "   - NoSQL databases follow the BASE model (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent) instead of the strict consistency \n",
    "   model of SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scalability:\n",
    "   - NoSQL databases are typically horizontally scalable, meaning you can add more servers to your NoSQL database to handle large \n",
    "   amounts of traffic and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Types:\n",
    "   - NoSQL databases are categorized into different types based on their data model, including document-oriented, key-value, column-family,\n",
    "   and graph databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Examples:\n",
    "   - MongoDB, CouchDB, Cassandra, Redis, Neo4j.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Structure:\n",
    "   - SQL databases store structured data in tables with a fixed schema, while NoSQL databases can store structured, semi-structured,\n",
    "   or unstructured data with a dynamic schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Query Language:\n",
    "   - SQL databases use SQL for defining and manipulating the data, while NoSQL databases may use different query languages, APIs, \n",
    "   or even simple key-value access methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Schema:\n",
    "   - SQL databases have a rigid, predefined schema, and any changes require careful planning. NoSQL databases allow for flexible or\n",
    "    dynamic schemas, adapting to changing data requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scalability:\n",
    "   - SQL databases are typically vertically scalable, whereas NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, allowing for distributed and\n",
    "    scalable architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Consistency:\n",
    "   - SQL databases follow the ACID properties, ensuring strong consistency. NoSQL databases often relax consistency to achieve high\n",
    "    availability and fault tolerance (BASE model).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Use Cases:\n",
    "   - SQL databases are suitable for applications with well-defined schemas and complex queries. NoSQL databases are often used in\n",
    "    scenarios where flexibility, scalability, and rapid development are more critical than strict consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of the application, data structure, and scalability needs. \n",
    "Each type has its strengths and weaknesses, and the decision should be made based on the characteristics of the data and the goals of the system."

    "DDL (Data Definition Language):\n",
    "DDL, or Data Definition Language, is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used for defining and managing the structure\n",
    "of a relational database. DDL statements are responsible for creating, modifying, and deleting database objects, such as tables,\n",
    "indexes, and constraints. Common DDL statements include `CREATE`, `DROP`, `ALTER`, and `TRUNCATE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore each of these DDL statements with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE:\n",
    "   - The `CREATE` statement is used to create new database objects, such as tables, indexes, or views.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Example: Creating a new table\n",
    "    CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "        id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "        name VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "        salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
    "    );\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, a new table named `employees` is created with columns for `id`, `name`, and `salary`. The `PRIMARY KEY` \n",
    "constraint is used to define the primary key for the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. DROP:\n",
    "   - The `DROP` statement is used to delete existing database objects, such as tables or indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Example: Dropping a table\n",
    "    DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "   This example deletes the `employees` table. It's important to note that the `DROP` statement removes the entire table and its data,\n",
    "   so use it with caution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ALTER:\n",
    "   - The `ALTER` statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as adding or dropping columns in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Example: Adding a new column to a table\n",
    "    ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "    ADD COLUMN department VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, a new column named `department` is added to the existing `employees` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TRUNCATE:\n",
    "   - The `TRUNCATE` statement is used to remove all rows from a table but retains the table structure for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Example: Truncating a table\n",
    "    TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "   Unlike the `DROP` statement, `TRUNCATE` removes all rows from the table without deleting the table itself. It is a faster operation than\n",
    "deleting rows one by one, especially for large tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "These DDL statements are essential for defining and managing the structure of a database. They allow developers and administrators to create,\n",
    "modify, and delete tables and other database objects, providing flexibility and control over the database schema. It's crucial to use these \n",

    "Let's explore three key DML statements: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`, with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. INSERT:\n",
    "   - The `INSERT` statement is used to add new records (rows) to a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: Inserting a new record into the \"employees\" table\n",
    "    INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary)\n",
    "    VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 50000.00);\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, a new record is inserted into the `employees` table with specified values for the `id`, `name`, and `salary` columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. UPDATE:\n",
    "   - The `UPDATE` statement is used to modify existing records in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Example: Updating the salary for an employee with id = 1\n",
    "    UPDATE employees\n",
    "    SET salary = 55000.00\n",
    "    WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "   This example updates the `salary` column for the employee with `id` equal to 1 in the `employees` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. DELETE:\n",
    "   - The `DELETE` statement is used to remove records from a table based on specified conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Example: Deleting an employee with id = 1\n",
    "    DELETE FROM employees\n",
    "    WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "   This example deletes the record of the employee with `id` equal to 1 from the `employees` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "DML statements are essential for managing the data within a database. They provide the means to insert new data, update existing data, \n",
    "and delete unwanted data. It's important to use these statements carefully and to include appropriate conditions in `UPDATE` and `DELETE`\n",
    "statements to avoid unintentional modifications or deletions of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that transactions and proper error handling are crucial when working with DML statements to ensure the integrity and consistency\n",

    "Primary Key:\n",
    "A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a relational database table that uniquely identifies each record in the table. \n",

    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of a primary key:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Uniqueness: Every value in the primary key column(s) must be unique.\n",
    "2. Non-null: The primary key column(s) cannot have a null value.\n",
    "3. Unchangeable: Once assigned, the values of the primary key should generally not be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of defining a primary key in SQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE students (\n",
    "    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",

    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a relational database table that establishes a link between data in two tables. \n",

    "Key characteristics of a foreign key:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Referential Integrity: The values in the foreign key column(s) must match the values in the referenced primary key column(s).\n",
    "2. No Orphans: A foreign key ensures that rows in the referencing table (child table) have corresponding rows in the referenced table (parent table).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of defining a foreign key in SQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE orders (\n",

    "   - The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the result set by one or more columns. This is often used with aggregate functions such as `SUM`,\n",
    "     `COUNT`, `AVG`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. HAVING:\n",
    "   - The `HAVING` clause is used to filter the grouped results. It is similar to the `WHERE` clause but is applied after the `GROUP BY`\n",
    "    clause to filter the groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. ORDER BY:\n",
    "   - The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the result set based on one or more columns. It is one of the last clauses to be executed, \n",
    "    affecting the final presentation of the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that not every query includes all of these clauses. The actual execution order can vary based on the specific\n",
    "requirements of the query. For example, if there is no `GROUP BY` clause, then the `HAVING` clause is not applicable, and the `ORDER BY` \n",
    "clause may be applied directly after the `WHERE` clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, some databases may optimize the execution plan based on indexes and other factors, so the physical order of execution \n",
    "might differ from the logical order described here. Understanding the order of execution helps in writing efficient and correct SQL queries."
